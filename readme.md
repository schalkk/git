# Learning Git with Plural Insight #
## The Reason ##
As part of the Python Developer 1 year basics program  this introduction to Git needs to be done. 

## Background ##
I am trying to learn to use Git from the Unix Commandline at the same time.
Thus, I have Git running in a Ubuntu bash shell.  I recently completed the basdh PluralInsight course as well.
Also learning to edit in tools like NANo and VIM.
